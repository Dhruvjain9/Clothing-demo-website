        <h2>Visual Try-On</h2>
        <img src="visual_tryon.jpg" alt="Visual Try-On" width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            Visual Try-On is a cutting-edge application of computer vision technology in the world of e-commerce. It allows customers to virtually try on clothing, accessories, and even makeup before making a purchase. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a device's camera, the customer can see themselves on the screen in real-time.</li>
            <li>The computer vision system accurately detects the customer's body and facial features.</li>
            <li>Virtual items, such as clothing or makeup, are superimposed onto the customer's image in real-time.</li>
            <li>Customers can see how the items fit and look on them, helping them make more informed buying decisions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Visual Try-On not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the likelihood of returns since customers can visualize the products on themselves accurately.
        </p>

        <h2>Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>
        <img src="augmented_reality.jpg" alt="Augmented Reality" width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            Augmented Reality is another fascinating application of computer vision in e-commerce. AR integrates digital content with the real world, providing customers with immersive experiences. Here are some key aspects of AR in e-commerce:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>AR allows customers to view products in their own environment through their smartphone or tablet cameras.</li>
            <li>For example, customers can place virtual furniture in their living room or try out different paint colors on their walls.</li>
            <li>This technology bridges the gap between online and offline shopping, making it more interactive and engaging.</li>
            <li>AR also enables interactive product demonstrations, helping customers understand complex products better.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            AR is revolutionizing the way customers interact with products and is particularly popular in industries like furniture, home decor, and fashion.

        <h2>Search by Image</h2>
        <img src="search_by_image.jpg" alt="Search by Image" width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            Search by Image is a feature that simplifies the online shopping experience by using computer vision. Instead of typing in keywords or product names, customers can upload or take a photo of an item and search for similar products. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Customers take a picture of an item they like or have seen in the real world.</li>
            <li>The computer vision system analyzes the image, identifying key features and characteristics.</li>
            <li>Based on the analysis, the e-commerce platform presents products that closely match the image's content.</li>
            <li>Customers can find the exact item or discover similar products, making the shopping process more convenient and efficient.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Search by Image is a powerful tool for finding products that may be challenging to describe in words, and it's especially valuable for fashion and home decor.
